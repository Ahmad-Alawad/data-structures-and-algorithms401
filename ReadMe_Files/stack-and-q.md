## Challenge
- Creating stacks & Queues methouds was one of the most good challenge to do, it was easy and learned alot about the algorithms.

## Approach & Efficiency
- I used stack and queue data structure to represent  the data or in different approaches

## API
 - methouds:

        Stack:

        push: it takes one value as argument and push it to the top of the stack

        pop: it pop the node in the top of the stack..

        peek: returns to you the value of the node in the top of the stack..

        is_empty: returns boolen if the stack is empty or not..

        Queue:

        enqueue: it takes one value as argument and add it to the rear of the queue

        dequeue: it pop the node in the fornt of the queue..

        peek: returns to you the value of the node in the front of the queue..

        isEmpty: returns boolen if the queue is empty or not..
