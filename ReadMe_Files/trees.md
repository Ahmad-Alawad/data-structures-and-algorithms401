# Trees
- binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

## Approach & Efficiency
- O(log2N)

## API
- inOrder : function return array contain all of the nodes in the tree depending on in order traversal 

- postOrder : function return array contain all of the nodes in the tree depending on post order traversal 

- preOrder : function return array contain all of the nodes in the tree depending on pre order traversal 

- __str__ : function to print the tree nodes

- contains : function return true if the tree contain the value or value not found 
- add : function to add new values to the tree
